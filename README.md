## DEPRECATED

Largely superseded by https://typelevel.org/sbt-typelevel/

Main difference is the website setup, see https://github.com/systemFw/upperbound or https://github.com/systemFw/dynosaur


---------------


My template for FP scala projects with cats-effect and fs2.
Testing based on munit.

Largely based on sbt-spiewak, plus scalafmt and mdoc.
